# Abstract Data Type

An `abstract data type` (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which data structure must adhere to.

The interface does not have any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.

Examples:

| Abstraction (`ADT`) | Implementation (`DS`)                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| List                 | Dynamic Array<br/>Linked List                                       |
| Queue                | Linked List based Queue<br/>Array based Queue<br/>Stack based Queue |
| Map                  | Tree Map<br/>Hash Map or Hash Table                                 |
| Vehicle              | Golf Cart <br/>Bicycle<br/>Smart Car                                |
